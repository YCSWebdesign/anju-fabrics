              The story of a family's journey from handloom to power-loom and then electronic-loom.
              The journey of Anju Fabrics began with a determined heart in 1989 by
              Mr. K.N Subramanian and Mr. P. Subramaniam in the domestic trade market.
              As a micro company, Anju Fabrics produced only bed curtain cloths, bedsheets,
              and cotton towels. Currently, we have grown to also manufacture a variety of kitchen,
              bathroom, and table linen products. In addition, we are a one-stop solution for the production
              of jacquard furnishing and upholstery fabrics. We work with almost all modern
              retailers at the moment. Anju Fabrics grew along with us, and we're now acclaiming a
              superior hand in global retail.
